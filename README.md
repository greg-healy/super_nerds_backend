## Instructions for CS361
Clone the repo

Create the virtual environment and install dependencies by running `pipenv install`. Note that if you don't have `pipenv` installed you may need to run `pip install pipenv`. Check out this article for more on pipenv: https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-manage-your-python-projects-with-pipenv

If you install any additional dependencies, be sure to push your update Pipfile as well. 

To run the app, enter the virtual environment with `pipenv shell`.

Type `flask run`. It should begin running on localhost:5000.
